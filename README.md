# BlockchainProject
Blockchain Implementation in Python
This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain in Python. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of a blockchain, including block creation, mining, and validation.

Features
SHA-256 Hashing: Uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm for block data.

Block Mining: Finds a nonce that satisfies the difficulty level.

Blockchain Validation: Ensures the integrity of the blockchain.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-python.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd blockchain-python
Usage
Running the Program
Execute the main function to see the blockchain in action:

bash
python blockchain.py
Example Output
The output will display the mined blocks and the validation status of the blockchain. Here’s an example:

Block#: 1
Hash: 0000abcd1234...
Previous: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Data: hello
Nonce: 1234

Block#: 2
Hash: 0000efgh5678...
Previous: 0000abcd1234...
Data: goodbye
Nonce: 5678

...
True
False
Code Overview
updatehash Function
Generates a SHA-256 hash for the given arguments.

Block Class
Represents a single block in the blockchain.

Attributes:

number: The block number.

previous_hash: The hash of the previous block.

data: The data stored in the block.

nonce: A number used for mining.

Methods:

hash(): Generates the block’s hash.

__str__(): Returns a string representation of the block.

Blockchain Class
Manages the chain of blocks.

Attributes:

difficulty: The number of leading zeros required in the hash.

chain: A list of blocks.

Methods:

add(block): Adds a block to the chain.

remove(block): Removes a block from the chain.

mine(block): Mines a block and adds it to the chain.

isValid(): Validates the blockchain.

Testing
Modify the main function to test different scenarios.
